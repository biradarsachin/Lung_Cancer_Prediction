# Lung_Cancer_Prevention

The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having lung cancer based on a set of independent features, including age, gender, air pollution, smoking, and other factors. The model was trained using a dataset of individuals with known lung cancer levels, categorized as low, medium, or high. By analyzing the independent features and their relationship to lung cancer risk, the project aimed to improve early detection and prevention of this deadly disease.
